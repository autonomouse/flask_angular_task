Make sure you have postgres and python3 installed before you start.

To install dependecies, run `$ ./do.py deps install`.

Run the following to create the database: `$sudo su postgres createdb hjtask`.

Then create the user: `$ sudo -u postgres createuser <username>`.

Then exist from the postgres suer and run `$ ./do.py db create` to set everything up.

After that, you can run the test server via: `$ ./do.py run`.

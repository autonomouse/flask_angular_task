Make sure you have postgres and python3 installed before you start.

Run `$ sudo su postgres` and create the database first, via: `$ createdb hjtask`.

Then exist from the postgres suer and run `$ ./do.py db create` to set everything up.

After that, you can run the test server via: `$ ./do.py run`.

Tests can be run using: `$ do.py test`.
